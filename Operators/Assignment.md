## Assignment Operators with Examples

* ### Arithmetic Assignment:
  * ```
    * Operator	    Example	               Same As
      =	            x = y	                 x = y
     + =	          x += y	               x = x + y
     - =	          x -= y	               x = x - y
     * =	          x *= y	               x = x * y
     / =	          x /= y	               x = x / y
     % =	          x %= y	               x = x % y
     ** =	          x **= y	               x = x ** y
  ```
* ### Bitwise Assignment:
    * ```
       & = : Performs a bitwise AND operation and assigns the result.
       | = : Performs a bitwise OR operation and assigns the result.
       ^ = : Performs a bitwise XOR operation and assigns the result.
       << = : Performs a bitwise left shift and assigns the result.
       >> = : Performs a bitwise right shift and assigns the result.
  ```
* ### Logical Assignment:
  * ````
      && = : Assigns the second operand if the first operand is truthy.
      || = : Assigns the second operand if the first operand is falsy.
      ?? = : Nullish Coalescing Assignment
    ```
